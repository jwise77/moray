That must have been a printer error because the manuscript states that
the rays are traced a maximum length of sqrt(3) of the box length on
Page 4, line 9, point (iv).  Was the referee referring to this
statement in the paper?

This maximum length of a ray of sqrt(3) of the box length was chosen
so that the rays would always traverse the entire box, where the
longest ray is from one corner of the domain to the opposite corner,
e.g. (0,0,0) -> (1,1,1).

Our current implementation cannot consider point sources outside of
the computational domain yet.  However the ray tracing can be used
with a uniform radiation background, where the local fluxes from point
sources are added to the background intensity.  We have added the
following sentence to the end of Section 2.1 to clarify this point.

"The last restriction prevents our method from considering sources
external to the computational domain, but a uniform radiation
background can be used in conjunction with ray tracing in Enzo+Moray
that adds the local radiation field to the background intensity."

Thank you for bringing this point to our attention.  We use this
estimate only when calculating the radiative transfer timestep.  Other
than that, the I-front velocity does not appear in the ray tracing,
and the solution should not be affected by neglecting the relativistic
terms.

We have modified the text to reflect that we consider the
non-relativistic ionisation front velocity.  We refer the reader to
Shapiro et al. (2006) for the I-front velocity in the relativistic
case in footnote #2.

This mistake has been fixed in the text.  The parameters used in Test
1 were the same as in the Radiative Transfer Comparison Project, T =
10^4 K, n = 10^-3 cm^-3, and x = 1.2 x 10^-3.

We checked the line cuts of Test 3 in Iliev et al. (2006) in their
Figures 27 and 28.  Figure 27 only covers the domain x = 0.6 -> 0.85
and does not show x = 0.86.  But in Figure 28, they show the
temperature cuts in x = 0.6->1.  Here C2Ray and CRASH have the same
behaviour as Enzo+Moray with the temperature gradually decreasing at x
~ 0.82, and they have a sharp increase at x ~ 0.88, which shows that
these codes also have little hard radiation leaking into the shadow.

Investigating this further, the Radiative Transfer Comparison Project
paper did not specify the initial neutral fraction of the test, but
the associated website specifies an initial neutral fraction of zero.
We initialized the test with an ionized fraction of zero inside the
clump and 1e-2 in the ambient region.  The sharp edge in neutral
fraction is caused by the partially ionized ambient medium instead of
a neutral medium.  You can see the ambient medium recombining with
time in our Figure 11 from x = 0.86 -> 1.

We have re-run Tests 3 and 7 to have an initially neutral medium to
match the comparison test and have replaced the appropriate figures.
We no longer see this sharp edge at x ~ 0.86.

We agree that this diagnostic is very useful for comparisons.  We now
present the same PDFs as the comparison papers for Tests 1-4 and 7.

Thank you very much for catching this.  We accidentally plotted the
data from t = 100 Myr instead of 10 Myr.  We have corrected the
figure.  Now, the density dip at x=0 is insignificant and matches with
the other codes in the comparison paper.

This was related to the different initial ionized fraction in Test 3.
These differences vanished when we used an initial ionized fraction of
zero.  With an initial x_e = 1e-2, the ambient medium was not heated
to T = 30,000 K because the lower absorption, and thus less
photo-heating, during the first few timesteps.

We have added a figure showing slices of the Mach number at 10 and 50
Myr.

We have moved Tests 8-14 into their own section, labelled Radiation
Hydrodynamical Applications, and refer to them as applications in the
paper, numbered from one to six.

Thank you for pointing this out.  We have proof-read the paper again.
We have added the ArXiv numbers to the references.  This was a
formatting error from ADS BibTeX listings.
